    <h1>Promises Game</h1>
    <p>Design and build a trivia game that uses promise-based timing</p>
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>The application should utilize the <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Trivia API</a></p>
    <p>The questions should be multiple choice and can be of any difficulty or category</p>
    <p>You should create a generic recursive promise with a timeout that manages the gameplay loop</p>
    <p>The player should press a button to start the game, then answer a series of questions (using buttons) with a time limit</p>
    <p>The user should be able to change their answer at any point before the timer runs out and it should be clear which answer they have currently selected</p>
