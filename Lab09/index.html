    <h1>Conducting User Testing</h1>
    <h2>Why We Conduct User Testing</h2>
    <p>Understanding how people actually use our applications is very important to sustained development.</p>
    <p>It is very easy to make assumptions about ideal users and ideal use-cases when we are developing something, but those assumptions tend to blow up the second we put our applications in the hands of users.</p>
    <p>User testing is best performed in an objective setting, following traditional research ettiquette.</p>
    <p>This includes things like restricting bias by acting as a neutral observer. You want to avoid training the user while they are exploring your app.</p>
    <p>You can give them a series of actions you want them to perform before you conduct the observation, but you should avoid getting involved or answering questions during the observation.</p>
    <h2>Data Definitions</h2>
    <em>Quantitative Data</em>
    <p>Quantitative data is data than you can do math with. Just because data is numeric, doesn't necessarily mean you can do math with it. Multiplying your zip code by 8 does not yield a meaningful result.</p>
    <p>You'll want to include at least two quantitative metrics in your observation.</p>
    <strong>This can be things like:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Time spent on the application</li>
        <li>Number of clicks per action</li>
        <li>Number of questions asked during observation</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Qualitative Data</em>
    <p>Qualitative data is also known as categorical data.</p>
    <p>Qualitative data <em>describes</em> things.</p>
    <p>While you cannot do math with it, it gives you insight into the thoughts, feelings, motivations, and demographics of your users.</p>
    <p>Include at least 5 qualitative metrics in your observation, with at least 2 of them being demographic.</p>
    <strong>Examples of demographic data:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Age Category (i.e. 18-25, 26-35, etc...)</li>
        <li>Gender Identity</li>
        <li>Tech Experience Level (i.e. no experience, some experience, etc...)</li>
        <li>Racial Identity</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Examples of non-demographic data:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Rating feature categories ordinally (i.e. Rate: Ease of Use on a scale of 1-5, etc...)</li>
        <li>Asking for feedback based on the<a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/what-is-a-likert-scale" target="_blank"> Likert Scale</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eliciting Comments</h2>
    <p>You should feature at least two fields for user comments.</p>
    <p>There is a trick to this.</p>
    <p>You can't ask leading questions that would influence potential answers, i.e. "How much do you love the really cool feature I added?"</p>
    <p>You can't ask overly-broad questions, i.e. "Do you like the app?"</p>
    <p>You also cannot simply put a box at the bottom that says "comments", because comments are universally seen as optional and most people skip them.</p>
    <p>Instead ask specific questions that yield actionable answers, like "What features do you feel are missing?" or "Was there anything you had a hard time finding?"</p>
    <p>Come up with at least two questions like this.</p>
    <h2>Taking Action</h2>
    <p>Using your testing data, identify two changes that you could make to your application that incorporate user feedback.</p>
    <p>Make sure you make these changes on your final project, I will look for them.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Design and print a minimum of 3 survey forms with a minimum of 9 questions (2 quantitative, 5 qualitative, 2 comments)</p>
    <p>Find 3 users (that are not you) and conduct a survey with each of them.</p>
    <p>Create a one page report on user testing that includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why you used the metrics you used</li>
        <li>How you interpreted the results</li>
        <li>The two changes you intend to make in your application</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, next Wedesday you will turn in: 3 user testing surveys(completed), and a one page testing summary. All should be printed.</p>
