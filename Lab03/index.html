    <h1>Weighted Decision Matrix - Refactor</h1>
    <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
    <p>Whenever we write software, we tend to use the tools and techniques that are considered ‘best practices’ at the time of writing. The problem is, ‘best practices’ change constantly. There is always something new or better coming onto the scene. Most businesses will only modernize their software if the benefit outweighs the “it works” of it all. Modernization is still a common task and at some point in your career it is likely you will be tasked with bringing in a library to improve the performance or readability of a piece of code you or another developer has written. </p>
    <p>For this lab you will be refactoring your Module 02 lab to utilize jQuery to improve performance and readability.</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Utilize your html and js files from the Module 02 lab to make the necessary changes. Zip both files together. Remember to ensure the directory reflected in the script tag matches the actual path to the file within the zipped folder. </p>
    <p>Save the zipped folder as yourlastname_yourfirstname_module03lab.html.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Replace all standard document selectors with the appropriate jQuery selector. </p>
    <p>Use jQuery to attach an event listener to the button. This event listener should call the function that performs your calculations for table 3. It should also use the jQuery show() function for table 3, which should be hidden by default.</p>
    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <p>You can wrap table 3 in a logical tag like div to handle the show/hide functionality. div is a block-level tag that has no inherent display values, allowing you to block off content and perform high level logical and formatting operations.</p>
    <p>show() and hide() set the CSS ‘display’ property for the element. You can default a tag to not show using the CSS property ‘display: none’</p>
