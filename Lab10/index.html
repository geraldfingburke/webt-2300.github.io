    <h1>GitHub Pages Portfolio</h1>
    <p>For this lab, you will be leveraging your work throughout the semester into a static portfolio site hosted on GitHub utilizing the Pages deployment tool.</p>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>In almost every dev interview I've had, at one point someone asked me to show them something I've worked on.</p>
    <p>GitHub is a fantastic way to share the code that we write.</p>
    <p>While it is super helpful to be able to share our code, we write code to build applications and enable processes.</p>
    <p>That's why it's equally important to be able to share what our code <em>does</em> as much as what it is or how it's structured.</p>
    <p>Developers, like artists, should have a portfolio that is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accessible from anywhere</li>
        <li>An accurate portrayal of the range of skill the developer possesses</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Being able to give an interviewer a link to a website that effectively communicates your skill and experience is incredibly handy.</p>
    <p>My portfolio can be found <a href="https://geraldburke.com">here</a></p>
    <p>This is where it's important to note that your portfolio should be tailored to you and show your personality.</p>
    <p>My portfolio has, this semester, been co-opted by learning content for this course.</p>
    <p>The actual development part of my portfolio is actually a little light.</p>
    <p>This is due to a combination of laziness in packaging and sharing personal projects, and the vast majority of my industry work being under NDA.</p>
    <p>My portfolio also features writing credits and games published.</p>
    <p>If you don't make games or write for publication, you don't need sections like these.</p>
    <p>But make sure that you consider all that you have to offer and share it in a way that is easy to find and easy to understand.</p>
    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>Go to GitHub</p>
    <img src="img/1.png" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub.com home page" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>Create a new repository</p>
    <p>Call it [your username].github.io</p>
    <img src="img/2.png" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub new repository wizard" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>Clone the repository</p>
    <img src="img/3.png" alt="A screenshot of the git command to clone a repository" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>Add a file called 'index.html'</p>
    <img src="img/4.png" alt="A screenshot of the linux command to create a new file called index.html with text reading 'Hellow World!'" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>Commit your changes</p>
    <img src="img/5.png" alt="A screenshot of the git command to add changes to staging and then commit them" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>Push</p>
    <img src="img/6.png" alt="A screenshot of the git command to push changes to remote repository" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>You should be able to find your index page @ [your username].github.io in a web browser</p>
    <img src="img/7.png" alt="A screenshot of the resulting index page on the remote server" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 500px;">
    <p>It may take a minute or two for changes to update</p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>Email me a link to your portfolio on D2L</p>
    <p>Your pages should consist of an index from which you can navigate to a minimum of two project directories</p>
    <p>For those of you that have a similar setup from your FTP directory on the geraldburke.com server, it's as simple as copying those files over to your repository</p>
    <p>Make sure that you put a little bit of personality into your portfolio.</p>
    <p>Dev interviews are vibe checks as much as they are skill checks</p>
    <p>Most leads are of the opinion that they can train technical skills, but they can't train being easy to work with.</p>
    <p>Getting along and having a rapport with a potential employer or team goes a long way in the interview process.</p>
    <p>Sometimes your portfolio will be reviewed before you're called for an interview.</p>
    <p>In these cases, you'll want to be sure that your portfolio communicates something about you.</p>
