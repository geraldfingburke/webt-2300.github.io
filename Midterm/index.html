    <h1>Midterm Project</h1>
    <p>For the midterm, you will be researching, designing, and presenting a project proposal for a client-side web service that consumes at least one public API.</p>
    <p>Your proposal must include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
        A slide deck presenting your project. Slide count is irrelevant as long as you are able to effectively communicate your design.
        </li>
        <li>
            A design document featuring:
            <ol>
                <li>An introduction</li>
                <li>Your chosen source API(s)</li>
                <li>An explaination of the data you will need from the API</li>
                <li>Wireframes for each page of your service</li>
                <li>A description of each milestone you'll reach in the project and an estimate on when the milestone will be complete (All milestones must be completable by finals week)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Requirements for the Application</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Your application must consume a public API</li>
        <li>Your application must use at least one JavaScript library (jQuery, AJAX, etc…)</li>
        <li>Your application must use data to change the DOM based on user input</li>
        <li>Your application must be deployed to the web server and be free of application breaking bugs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Advice</h1>
    <p>Do not bite off more than you can chew. As long as the above bullet points are hit, I can say with confidence you know enough JavaScript to make it as a junior front-end developer. However, do not sell yourself short. This is an opportunity to build your portfolio, learn some new skills, and build something you can be proud of. If you need any help figuring out what to do, I’m available, though I would suggest just looking through that list of public APIs and find something you’re interested in.</p>
