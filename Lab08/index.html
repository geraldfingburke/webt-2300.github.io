<h1>The Easter Egg Event</h1>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You are a web developer and you were contracted by a local business, Doug's Dogs, to build a website.</p>
<p>After building the website, the business informed you that they cannot pay you the agreed rate and claimed to be dissatisfied with aspects of the site they specifically requested.</p>
<p>You have them in a 12-month contract for hosting. Even though you are only making 10 dollars a month from the hosting, you can't afford to just sever the contract.</p>
<p>You decide to get even in a way only a developer can: You decide to plant an easter egg on their site.</p>
<h2>Requirments</h2>
<p>Hide a JavaScript event based easter egg in a local copy of <a href="dougs-dogs" target="_blank">this website</a></p>
<p>Put the lab in an easy to identify directory on the web server</p>
<h2>Some Rules</h2>
<p>Easter eggs are typically meant to be playful or silly references. Your easter egg should not feature explicit content.</p>
<p>Easter eggs as a phenomena in media are typically traced back to Warren Robinette, the creator of Atari's Adventure.</p>
<p>I once went to a conference where he gave the keynote</p>
<p>He spoke about fitting the code for Adventure into a miniscule space ~1440 bytes iirc, his work as a VR reasearcher at UNC Chapel Hill, and climate change</p>
<p>It was an awesome talk and my buddy and I approached him afterwards</p>
<p>My buddy says, "Hey, I loved your talk"</p>
<p>Warren gets really serious, stares daggers into him and asks "What did you like about it"</p>
<p>My buddy tried to save it by saying "It was really good, all of it"</p>
<p>Warren, never breaking eye contact, asks him "What <em>specifically</em> did you like about it?"</p>
<p>Right around that time, Warren gets pulled away somewhere else, while my friend stood there confused and I shook with joy knowing I would spend the rest of my life telling that story every chance I got.</p>
<p>But that is a digression, essentially in the early days of games, game developers were seen only as engineers, not artists</p>
<p>Because of this, the companies that published games saw no need to credit the incredibly talented and creative people actually making the games</p>
<p>In a bit of defiance, Warren hid his name in the art of the game in a place that was only accessible through a complicated set of tasks</p>
<p>Creative people have since used easter eggs as a way to get one over on the money people that are blind to them</p>
