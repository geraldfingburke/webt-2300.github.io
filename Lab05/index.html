    <h1>Pair Programming Exercise</h1>
    <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
    <p>It is very common within the industry for two or more developers to work on the same problem simultaneously. Unless you are working on a very small team and are the only developer on your team, your greatest resource is going to be the developers around you. </p>
    <p>Pair programming is a type of collaborative coding practice where one person “drives” (sits at the keyboard and writes the code) and the other advises. During this process, you should be communicating openly and making decisions together.  </p>
    <h2>The Lab</h2>
    <p>Create a new directory in your FTP folder called lab-05. </p>
    <p>Only one of you will need to do create the directory. </p>
    <p>Use this API for all following instructions: </p>
    <p>https://metmuseum.github.io/ </p>
    <p>Read the documentation to learn how to get a list of departments. </p>
    <p>Choose a department and add a title, image, and description for the first ten pieces in the department to the DOM in a table. </p>
    <p>For an example of how to do this, see: <a href="https://geraldburke.com/gwburke/Zelda">Hyrule Compendium</a></p>
    <p>In your footer, include a copyright statement that includes both of your full names (first, last) </p>
    <p>“Looks good” is subjective, but make sure it does, because “Looks bad” is objective. </p>
    <p>You should take turns driving and advising. Set a timer for 10-20 minutes and switch every time it goes off. </p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>A complete working site of the above description hosted in one or both of your directories. Be sure to give me a link to the site when you feel you are done. </p>
